Flags for Pentest like Watch Dogs 2

Did you play Watch Dogs 2?

Have you seen a virus to mark someone's computer that has been hacked by Marcus?

Yes, I tried to make the Virus from the game come true and at the same time wanted to fill my spare time after playing the game.

Just like this :

NOTE :
Hey. This Flags running Spam Command in Command Prompt so this Flags or Virus will not be closed unless you have to close it via Powershell Interaction

and...

This virus is more fun when you upload and run it from Metasploit, because this is only to mark computers that you have hacked!

and again...

Have Fun :)
